<pre>The radio spectrum that is most often used by radio astronomers to observe the universe (frequencies of a few GHz) is also widely used by modern technology, leading to interference. Radio telescopes are very sensitive detectors of radio waves, so man-made devices that emit radio waves are easily seen.
    Although these devices are far less powerful than the jets of plasma emanating from a supermassive black hole in a distant galaxy, they are far, far closer.
    Since most interference is man-made, it follows the human population. Thus, remote areas might be expected to have less interference. The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is 20km away from Narrabri, in a shire of only 14000 people. Nevertheless, radio frequency interference is a major problem.</pre>
